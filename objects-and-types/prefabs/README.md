# Prefabs


**Prefabs** are **Objects** that are composed of a combination of **Objects**. They allow the user to create multiple individual **Instances** of this combination and then make changes that are enacted across all of them. Each **Instance** can also retain unique properties via overrides, thus allowing one to create several **Objects** with the same functionality but different characteristics. Moreover, **Prefabs** have their own **Logic** encapsulated within them.

The first section shows how to create and use **Prefabs**, the second section gives more details about the **Logic** of **Prefabs**, and the third section describes **Nested Prefabs**.

## Prefabs in **Scene2Ds**

**Prefabs** in **Scene2Ds** are treated as **Frames**, but with the properties of a **Prefab**. On the surface, they essentially work the same as **Prefabs** in **Scenes**.
