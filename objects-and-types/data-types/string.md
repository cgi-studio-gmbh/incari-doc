# String

A **String** is a **Data Type** that represents a sequence of alphanumerical characters.

They are most commonly used to hold words and text.

Numbers can also be represented as **Strings**, but they are still text, not numbers; for instance, $$1 + 1 = 2$$ in _numerical_ terms, but $$"1" + "1" = "11"$$ in _string_ terms, because it is text added together, not actual values.

In **Incari**, there is a special category of **Nodes** \([**String**](../../toolbox/string/)\) for creating and handling **Strings**.

As of 2024.1, **Incari Studio** now supports all [*UTF-8*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) characters. This enables the user to incorporate special characters such as `é`, `ä`, `π` and `¿`. This means that file systems using *UTF-8* characters can be handled by **Incari**, like a **Project's** path name. However, it is important to note that currently the results of several **String Nodes** may be unreliable when **Strings** using *UTF-8* characters are used.
