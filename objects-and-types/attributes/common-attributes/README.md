# Common Attributes

The same sets of **Attributes** often appear in different **Objects**. The **Transformation Attributes**, for instance, are present for every kind of **Scene Object** in **Incari**.  

If there are any caveats or atypical functionality within the context of a particular **Object**, then that information will be noted on its corresponding page.

The **Common Attributes** are:

* [**Transformation**](transformation/README.md)
  * [**Global**](transformation/global.md)
  * [**Local**](transformation/local.md)
* [**Object**](object.md)
* [**Sprite**](sprite.md)
* [**Tag.**](tag.md)
