# Attributes

Entities in **Incari**, such as **Objects**, **Nodes**, **Screens** etc., each have a set of **Attributes**. An **Attribute** defines a specific characteristic of an entity, and thus by modifying the **Value** of these **Attributes** you can modify its characteristics.

Generally, **Attributes** fall into one of two categories:

* **Object Attributes** - Modify the characteristics of **Objects** and can be edited in the **Attribute Editor**
* **Node Attributes** - Modify the behavior and characteristics of **Nodes** and can be edited in the **Node Attribute Editor**.
