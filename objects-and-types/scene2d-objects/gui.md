# GUI

A *GUI*, or graphical user interface, uses graphics to let a user interact with an interface. In **Incari**, there are two simple features which are available to create and edit in **Scene2Ds**. They are:

* [Button](gui.md#button)
* [Label](gui.md#label)

## Button

A **Button** is a simple icon to attach **Logic** to. Its text, placement, and size can be altered in the **Attribute Editor**.

## Label

A **Label Object** essentially acts as a text box for a label. Any text can be added to the **Label** using the `Label` **Attribute** in the **Attribute Editor**. 

Initially, the **Label** displays the text `Label`.

Locating the `Text` **Attribute**, any text can be inputted to provide clear information for a *User Interface*. Here, the test text `Hello World` is supplied.

There is also the **Get LabelText Node**. More information can be found [here.](../../../toolbox/incari/vector/label/README.md)
