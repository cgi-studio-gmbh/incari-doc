# Ellipse

The **Ellipse** in **Incari** provides similar functionality as its equivalent in *Figma*. 

![Ellipse.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmaellipse.png)



There are several **Attributes** which allow the user heightened customizability and control. 

* [**Transformation**](figmaellipse.md#transformation)
* [**Blending**](figmaellipse.md#blending)
* [**Fill**](figmaellipse.md#fill)
* [**Stroke**](figmaellipse.md#stroke)
* [**Ellipse**](figmaellipse.md#ellipse)
* [**Mask**](figmaellipse.md#mask)
* [**Style**](figmaellipse.md#style)
* [**Tag**](figmaellipse.md#tag)

# Attributes


## Transformation

![Transformation Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/buttonattstransformation.png)

The `Transformation` **Attributes** deal with placement, rotation, and size in *XY* space. More information can be found [here](../../attributes/common-attributes/transformation/README.md).

## Blending

![Blending Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmablendingattribute.png)

This **Attribute** lets the user set a `Blend Mode` as a base property of the **Ellipse**. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). An **Object's** `Blend Mode` can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).


## Fill

The `Fill` **Attributes** consist of different items called `Elements`. Each `Element` contains a `Type`. This can be either `Solid` or `Image` and changes some of the available **Attributes** under this category.

If there is more than one `Fill Element`, the most recent one will take precedent over the others (unless some `Blend Mode` is applied).

### Solid

![Fill Attributes with Type Solid.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmafillattributes.png)

When `Solid` is selected, `Color` is visible. 

* `Color` is a color selector that lets the user pick the `Fill's` color. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Fill Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Fill` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.

### Image

![Fill Attributes with Type Image.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmafillimageatts.png) 

When `Image` is selected, `Image` and `Fit Mode` are visible. 

* `Image` is the desired **Texture** file.
  
* `Fit Mode` determines how the **Texture** is displayed. These can be `Fill`, `Fit`, `Crop`, and `Tile`. `Tile` has the additional **Attribute** of `Scale Factor`, which augments the tesselation. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Fill Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Fill` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.

## Stroke

The `Stroke` **Attributes** consist of different items called `Elements`. Each `Element` contains a `Type`. This can be either `Solid` or `Image` and changes some of the available **Attributes** under this category. There are also two fixed **Attributes** outside of the `Elements`. These are:

* `Width`, which is how wide (in pixels) each `Stroke` will appear. This applies to each `Stroke Element`. 
* `Position`, which determines what part of the outline identifies the outside of the **Object**. For example, if `Inner` is selected, then the outside of the `Stroke` is the outside of the **Object**. If `Center` is selected, then the `Stroke's` center is the outside of the **Object**. If `Outer` is selected, then the inside of the `Stroke` is the outside of the **Object**.

![Stroke Attributes with Type Solid.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmastrokesolid.png)

When `Solid` is selected, `Color` is visible. 

* `Color` is a color selector that lets the user pick the `Stroke's` color. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Stroke Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Stroke` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.


![Stroke Attributes with Type Image.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmastrokeimage.png)

When `Image` is selected, `Image` and `Fit Mode` are visible. 

* `Image` is the desired **Texture** file.
  
* `Fit Mode` determines how the **Texture** is displayed. These can be `Fill`, `Fit`, `Crop`, and `Tile`. `Tile` has the additional **Attribute** of `Scale Factor`, which augments the tesselation. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Stroke Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Fill` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.

## Ellipse

![Ellipse Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmaellipseatts.png)

These **Attributes** give the foundation properties of the **Ellipse Object**. 

* `Arc Sector` determines the percentage of the the **Ellipse** visible. For example, if it is set to 100, the entire **Ellipse** shows and if it is set to 50, only half shows.

* `Thickness` ranges from 0 to 100. If it is set to 0, there is no white space in the center of the **Ellipse** at all. If set to 100, the entire **Ellipse** is replaced by white space. If set to 50, part of the center is white space, creating a 'donut-like' shape. 

* `Start Angle` ranges from 0 to 360 and determines at which angle the start of the **Ellipse** begins. If `Arc Sector` is set to 100, this will have not have any visual impact. 

## Mask 

A **Mask** is an **Object** that shows a certain area of another **Object** while concealing the rest. Any **Object** (e.g., an **Ellipse**, **Rectangle**, **Frame**, **Group**, or **Text**) can be used as a **Mask**. 

For easier visualization, think of the **Mask** as a cookie cutter while the masked **Object** is the dough: the cookie cutter shows only a part and discards the rest.

![Mask Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmamaskattsreal.png)

The `Type` **Attribute** has three options:

* `None` - nothing is applied. 
* `Alpha` - the **Mask** has an opacity level (alpha channel) determining with which level of opacity (or transparency) the masked **Object** is revealed: 0% opacity reveals nothing, 100% opacity is equivalent to a **Mask** with `Vector` type.
* `Vector` - only modifies the shape outline of the masked **Object**
* `Luminance` - allows the user to utilize brightness to determine the effect of the **Mask**; the brighter the area of a **Mask**, the more that is revealed and the darker the area, the less that is revealed.

`Object` allows the user to select what should be the masked **Object**.

`Apply Mask` is a toggle that applies the **Mask** when set to on, and disables the **Mask** when set to off. 

## Style 

![Style Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmastyleatts.png)

The `Style` **Attributes** allow for more customizability. This can override any stylesheet provided in the [**Project Settings**](../../../modules/project-settings/style.md) or a [**Scene2D**](../../project-objects/scene2d.md). 

To address these in the **Logic**, please refer to the [**Object 2D Nodes**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/README.md).

* `CSS Classes` contain the *CSS* class names of the **Object**. 

* `Stylesheet` contains the *CSS* stylesheet of the **Object**.

## Tag

![Tag Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/buttonattstag.png)

This **Attribute** manages the *tags* for the **Button**. See more on *tags* [here.](../../attributes/common-attributes/tag.md)
