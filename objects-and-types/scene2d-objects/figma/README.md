# Vector

The **Vector Objects** in **Scene2Ds** implement some updated concepts in **Incari** which build upon the previous [**Vectors**](../vector2d.md) while incorporating functionalities seen in *Figma*. The purpose of this is to lend greater customizability to the user so that they are able to import *Figma* projects using the [**Figma Importer**](../../../modules/figma-importer.md) and continue making use of fills, strokes, masks, etc. in **Incari**. 

It is important to note that since **2023.2**, the old **Vector Objects** no longer appear in **Incari Studio**. They are also deprecated, meaning that while they may appear in older **Projects**, they are not supported.
