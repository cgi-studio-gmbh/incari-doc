# Text 

The **Text** in **Incari** provides similar functionality as its equivalent in *Figma*. 

![Text.](../../../.gitbook/assets/text2dimage120232.png)

There are several **Attributes** which allow the user heightened customizability and control. 

* [**Transformation**](figmatext.md#transformation)
* [**Blending**](figmatext.md#blending)
* [**Fill**](figmatext.md#fill)
* [**Font**](figmatext.md#font)
* [**Stroke**](figmatext.md#stroke)
* [**Mask**](figmatext.md#mask)
* [**Text**](figmatext.md#text)
* [**Tag**](figmatext.md#tag)

# Attributes

## Transformation

![Transformation Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/buttonattstransformation.png)

The `Transformation` **Attributes** deal with placement, rotation, and size in *XY* space. More information can be found [here](../../attributes/common-attributes/transformation/README.md).

## Blending

![Blending Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmablendingattribute.png)

This **Attribute** lets the user set a `Blend Mode` as a base property of the **Text**. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). An **Object's** `Blend Mode` can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

## Fill

The `Fill` **Attributes** consist of different items called `Elements`. Each `Element` contains a `Type`. This can be either `Solid` or `Image` and changes some of the available **Attributes** under this category.

If there is more than one `Fill Element`, the most recent one will take precedent over the others (unless some `Blend Mode` is applied).

### Solid

![Fill Attributes with Type Solid.](../../../.gitbook/assets/booleanoperationfill20232.png)

When `Solid` is selected, `Color` is visible. 

* `Color` is a color selector that lets the user pick the `Fill's` color. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Fill Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Fill` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.

### Image

![Fill Attributes with Type Image.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmafillimageatts.png) 

When `Image` is selected, `Image` and `Fit Mode` are visible. 

* `Image` is the desired **Texture** file.
  
* `Fit Mode` determines how the **Texture** is displayed. These can be `Fill`, `Fit`, `Crop`, and `Tile`. `Tile` has the additional **Attribute** of `Scale Factor`, which augments the tesselation. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Fill Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Fill` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.

## Font

![Font Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmatextfontatts.png)

The `Font` **Attributes** controls many properties of a **Text Object**, such as:

* `Family`, which offers three different font types: `monospace`, `sans-serif`, and `serif`. More fonts can be added by the user in [**Project Settings**](../../../modules/project-settings/fonts.md).
* `Size` controls how large or small the text is.
* `Line Height (%)` determines the spacing between lines of text.
* `Letter Spacing (px)` determines the spacing between each individual letter.
* `Paragrpah Spacing` determines the spacing between each paragraph. 
* `Horizontal Alignment` decides the alignment of the text horizontally within the text space. It can be either `Left`, `Center`, or `Right`. 
* `Vertical Alignment` decides the alignment of the text vertically within the text space. It can either be `Top`, `Center`, or `Bottom`. 

## Stroke

The `Stroke` **Attributes** consist of different items called `Elements`. Each `Element` contains a `Type`. This can be either `Solid` or `Image` and changes some of the available **Attributes** under this category. There are also two fixed **Attributes** outside of the `Elements`. These are:

* `Width`, which is how wide (in pixels) each `Stroke` will appear. This applies to each `Stroke Element`. 
* `Position`, which determines what part of the outline identifies the outside of the **Object**. For example, if `Inner` is selected, then the outside of the `Stroke` is the outside of the **Object**. If `Center` is selected, then the `Stroke's` center is the outside of the **Object**. If `Outer` is selected, then the inside of the `Stroke` is the outside of the **Object**.


### Solid

![Stroke Attributes with Type Solid.](../../../.gitbook/assets/booleanoperationstroke20232.png)

When `Solid` is selected, `Color` is visible. 

* `Color` is a color selector that lets the user pick the `Stroke's` color. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Stroke Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Stroke` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.

### Image

![Stroke Attributes with Type Image.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmastrokeimage.png)

When `Image` is selected, `Image` and `Fit Mode` are visible. 

* `Image` is the desired **Texture** file.
  
* `Fit Mode` determines how the **Texture** is displayed. These can be `Fill`, `Fit`, `Crop`, and `Tile`. `Tile` has the additional **Attribute** of `Scale Factor`, which augments the tesselation. 

* Similar to the base property described previously, `Blend Mode` here affects the `Stroke Elements` only. These are established on common formulas, examples of each can be accessed [here](http://www.simplefilter.de/en/basics/mixmods.html). It can also be set with the [**Set Blend Mode Node**](../../../toolbox/incari/object2d/setblendmode.md).

* `Opacity` refers to how opaque or transparent the `Fill` appears. This is represented by an integer between 0 and 1.

## Mask 

A **Mask** is an **Object** that shows a certain area of another **Object** while concealing the rest. Any **Object** (e.g., an **Ellipse**, **Rectangle**, **Frame**, **Group**, or **Text**) can be used as a **Mask**. 

For easier visualization, think of the **Mask** as a cookie cutter while the masked **Object** is the dough: the cookie cutter shows only a part and discards the rest.

![Mask Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmamaskattsreal.png)

The `Type` **Attribute** has three options:

* `None` - nothing is applied. 
* `Alpha` - the **Mask** has an opacity level (alpha channel) determining with which level of opacity (or transparency) the masked **Object** is revealed: 0% opacity reveals nothing, 100% opacity is equivalent to a **Mask** with `Vector` type.
* `Vector` - only modifies the shape outline of the masked **Object**
* `Luminance` - allows the user to utilize brightness to determine the effect of the **Mask**; the brighter the area of a **Mask**, the more that is revealed and the darker the area, the less that is revealed.

`Object` allows the user to select what should be the masked **Object**.

`Apply Mask` is a toggle that applies the **Mask** when set to on, and disables the **Mask** when set to off. 

## Text

![Text Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/figmatexttextatts.png)

Here, the user can input the desired text of the **Text Object**. 

## Tag

![Tag Attributes.](../../../.gitbook/assets/buttonattstag.png)

This **Attribute** manages the *tags* for the **Button**. See more on *tags* [here.](../../attributes/common-attributes/tag.md)
