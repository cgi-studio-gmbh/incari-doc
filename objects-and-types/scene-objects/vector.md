# Vector

The **Vector Objects** provide alternatives to their **Vector2D** counterparts and encompass several three-dimensional shapes that help build up the visual aspects of a _User Interface_. Unlike **Vector2D**, **Vector Objects** *do* contain Z axis components.

There are several **Vector Objects** that are described below:

* [Arc](vector.md#arc)
* [Ellipse](vector.md#ellipse)
* [Line](vector.md#line)
* [Pie](vector.md#pie)
* [Rectangle](vector.md#rectangle)

## Arc

A **3D Object** that is a piece of a circle defined by a starting and ending degree disregarding the center and running straight through between the two selected degree points. It can be *transformed* along the X, Y, or Z axes. There are several **Nodes** attributed to **Arc Objects**, which can be found [_here_](../../toolbox/incari/vector/arc/README.md).

## Ellipse

A circular **3D** **Object** that can be *transformed* along the X, Y, and Z axes. 

## Line

A linear **3D** **Object** that can be *transformed* along the X, Y, and Z axes. There are several **Nodes** attributed to **Line Objects**, which can found [_here_](../../toolbox/incari/vector/line/README.md).

## Pie

A **3D** **Object** that is a piece of a circle defined by a starting and ending degree and a connected point at the center of the circle. It can be *transformed* along the X, Y, and Z axes. There are several **Nodes** attributed to **Line Objects**, which can be found [_here_](../../toolbox/incari/vector/pie/README.md).

## Rectangle

A rectangular **3D** **Object** that can be *transformed* along the X, Y, and Z axes. There are several **Nodes** attributed to **Rectangle Objects**, which can be found [_here_](../../toolbox/incari/vector/rectangle/README.md).
