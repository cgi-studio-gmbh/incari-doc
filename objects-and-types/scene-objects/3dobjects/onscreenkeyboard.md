# On-Screen Keyboard

The **On-Screen Keyboard** is a keyboard that appears on the screen. It can be used by a user to incorporate a variety of functions in the _User Interface_, such as inputting text or selecting based on a specified key, directly on a screen rather than requiring additional hardware.

The two images below show an **On-Screen Keyboard** in the viewport of **Incari Studio** and the **Incari Player**.
