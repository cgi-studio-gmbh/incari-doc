# Label

The **Label Object**, located under the **3D** section of the **Scene Outliner**, essentially acts as a text box for a label. Any text can be added to the **Label** using the `Text` **Attribute** in the **Attribute Editor**. 

Initially, the **Label** displays the text `Enter text here`.

Locating the `Text` **Attribute**, any text can be inputted to provide clear information for a *User Interface*. Here, the test text `Hello World` is supplied.
