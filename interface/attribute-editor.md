# Attribute Editor

**Attributes** are features that are applied to **Objects** in Incari, so that the **Objects** can exhibit specific properties and behaviors in a **Scene**.

The **Attribute Editor** holds the **Attributes** for all **Objects** in Incari and therefore, **Attributes** are edited here.

While some **Attributes** are shared between **Objects**, others are unique in which **Objects** they belong to and in order to access the **Attributes** of an **Object**, the **Object** is selected in the **Scene Outliner** by **clicking** on it. This will show the **Attributes** in the **Attribute Editor**. 

To open the **Attribute Editor**, *right-click* on the *Menu bar* in Incari and *click* on **Attribute Editor** from the drop-down list. This is seen in the illustration below:
