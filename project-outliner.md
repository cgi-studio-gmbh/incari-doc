# Project Outliner

## Project Outliner

### Overview

The **Project Outliner** contains a structured list of every **Scene** and **Screen** in a **Project**, and can be used to organize, manage, create, delete and edit them.

### Creating

New **Screens** and **Scenes** can be created in the following ways:

* Click on the plus ![](.gitbook/assets/plusIcon%20%284%29%20%282%29.PNG) icon located at the top left corner of the **Project Outliner**, after that click the `Scene` button.
* Right-click inside the **Project Outliner** and select `Create` &gt; `Scene` from the pop-up.
* Select `File` &gt; `New Screen` or `New Scene` from the drop-down **Menu**.
* Pressing `Ctrl`+`N` whilst the **Project Outliner** is active.

### Disabling Screens

When you **Start** the **Simulation** of a **Project** in Incari, all **Screens** will initialize in separate windows. By disabling a **Scene** in the **Project Outliner**, you can prevent a **Screen** from being included in the **Simulation**.

To disable a **Screen**, simply click the eye \(üëÅ\) icon.

### Unassigned Scenes

Unless a **Scene** is assigned to a **Screen**, it will appear under `Unassigned Scenes`, and therefore it will be excluded from the **Simulation**. When you create a **Scene**, it is unassigned by default. Unless a **Screen** was selected when it was created, in which case, it will be assigned to that **Screen**.

### Rearranging Scenes

**Scenes** can be rearranged easily by dragging and dropping them to a new place in the **Project Outliner**. Not only does this make it easier to organize **Scenes**, but you can also move them to an entirely different **Screen** or disable them entirely, by moving them into `Unassigned Scenes`.
