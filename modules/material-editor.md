# Material Editor

The **Material Editor** allows us to create a **Material** that gives a **Mesh** a specific visual appearance when it comes into contact with **Light** in a **Scene**. The **Material** files have an `.incmat` as their filename extension.

To open the **Material Editor**, double-click on a **Material** file in the **Asset Manager** or right-click on the Menu bar in **Incari** and click on **Material Editor** from the drop-down list. This can be seen in the illustration below:

The sections defined in the **Material Editor** are discussed below:

Note: These sections will not be opened if a **Material** file has already been opened in the **Material Editor**.

The `Used Materials` section has **Materials** that have been previously applied to a **Mesh** in a **Scene**. These **Materials** can be edited by clicking on them.

`New Material`, as its name suggests, allows us to create new **Materials**. The illustration below depicts its behavior when clicked.

`Open Material` opens a window that allows us to select an existing **Material** file. An example of the window is shown below:

Once a **Material** has been opened, the **Material** **Editor** allows the user to edit the **Material's** **Attributes**, as shown in the images below. Along with ways to edit **Shadow** and **Texture**, **Incari** now supports the use of _normal mapping_ with the `Normal Maps` **Attribute**. This allows the user to upload a **Normal Map** file that, when applied, can improve the detail and complexity of a **Mesh** which is made up of a low number of polygons \(simply put, less complex\). This also helps streamline the rendering process. With this type of texture mapping, **Meshes** in **Incari** will seem as detailed as complicated ones, while being more efficient.
