# Project Outliner

## Overview

The **Project Outliner** contains a structured list of every **Scene** and **Screen** in a **Project** and can be used to organize, manage, create, delete, and edit them.

## Disabling Screens

When you **Start** the **Simulation** of a **Project** in **Incari**, all **Screens** will initialize in separate windows. By disabling a **Scene** in the **Project Outliner**, you can prevent a **Screen** from being included in the **Simulation**.

To disable a **Screen**, simply click the eye (üëÅ) icon.

## Unassigned Scenes

Unless a **Scene** is assigned to a **Screen**, it will appear under `Unassigned Scenes` and will be excluded from the **Simulation**. When a **Scene** is created it is unassigned by default -- unless a **Screen** was selected when it was created, then it will be assigned to that **Screen**.

## Rearranging Scenes

**Scenes** can be rearranged easily by dragging and dropping them to a new place in the **Project Outliner**. Not only does this make it easier to organize **Scenes**, but you can also move them to an entirely different **Screen** or disable them completely by moving them into `Unassigned Scenes`.
