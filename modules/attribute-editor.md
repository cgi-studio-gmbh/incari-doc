# Attribute Editor

**Attributes** are features that are applied to **Objects** in **Incari** so that the **Objects** can exhibit specific properties and behaviors in a **Scene**.

The **Attribute Editor** holds the **Attributes** for all **Objects** in **Incari** and, therefore, **Attributes** are edited here.

While some **Attribute** types are shared between different **Objects**, others are unique to a single type. In order to view and modify the **Attributes** of an **Object**, simply select the **Object** in the **Scene Outliner** to show its **Attributes** in the **Attribute Editor**.
