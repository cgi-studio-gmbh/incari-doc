# Plugins Editor

The **Plugins Editor** allows one to activate or deactivate parts of **Incari**. At the moment, this is specific to **Communication** in **Incari**. For example, when the **SerialManager** is deactivated, all **Serial Communication** related components will not be loaded or played in the **Incari Player**.
