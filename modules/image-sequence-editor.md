# Image Sequence Editor

## Overview

The **Image Sequence Editor** allows to create and edit **Image Sequences**. **Image Sequences** in the **Asset Manager** have the extension `.incseq`. To open the **Image Sequence Editor**, either open it from the top panel of **Incari** and then select the **Image Sequence** to edit or simply double click on the **Image Sequence** in the **Asset Manager**.

Once an **Image Sequence** is open in the **Image Sequence Editor**, images can be added or removed from the sequence and their order can be changed.

The top panel gives the options to save or clear the **Image Sequence**.
