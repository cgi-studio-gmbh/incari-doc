# Image Sequence Editor

## Overview

The **Image Sequence Editor** allows to create and edit **Image Sequences**, which have the extension `.incseq` in the **Asset Manager**.

To open the **Image Sequence Editor**, either open it from `View` in the top panel of _Incari_, _right-click_ on the _Menu bar_ in _Incari_ and _click_ on **Image Sequence Editor** from the drop-down list, or simply double click on the **Image Sequence** to edit in the **Asset Manager**.

Once an **Image Sequence** is open in the **Image Sequence Editor**, images can be added or removed from the sequence and their order can be changed.

The top panel gives the options to save or clear the **Image Sequence**.
