# Code Editor

The **Code Editor** allows to edit the code of `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files. The top panel has the options of saving and reloading the file.

When first opened, it offers the options of selecting a file used in the **Scene**, creating a new file, or selecting an existing file from the **Assets** folder.

It can also be opened by directly double-clicking an `.html`, `.css` or `.js` file.
