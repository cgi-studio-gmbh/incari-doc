# Localization

![The Localization Settings.](../../.gitbook/assets/projsettslocalization20241.png)

The **Localization Settings** allow the user to begin the process of incorporating streamlined translation within an **Incari Project**. 

The `Localization file` is the desired `.local` file created in the [**Model Editor**](../model-editor.md). Through this file, the user can choose the `Current Language` and a `Fallback Language` if the translation for the `Current Language` does not exist in the file.
