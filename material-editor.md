# Material Editor

The **Material Editor** allows us to create a **Material** that gives a **Mesh** a specific visual appearance, when it comes into contact with **Light** in a **Scene**. The **Material** files have a _.incmat_ as their filename extension.

In order to open the **Material Editor**, _double-click_ on a **Material** file in the **Asset Manager** or _right-click_ on the _Menu bar_ in Incari and _click_ on **Material Editor** from the drop-down list. This can be seen in the illustration below:

The sections defined in the **Material Editor** are discussed below:

Note: These sections will not be opened if a **Material** file has already been opened in the **Material Editor**.

`Used Materials` section, has **Materials** that have been previously applied to a **Mesh** in a **Scene**. These **Materials** can be edited by _clicking_ on them.

`New Material` as its name suggests allows us to create new **Materials**. The illustration below depicts its behavior when _clicked_.

`Open Material` opens a window that allows us to select an existing **Material** file. An example of the window is shown below:
