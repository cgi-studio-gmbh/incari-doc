# Incari HMI Development Platform



**Incari Studio** is a development platform for creating complex *Human Machine Interface* (HMI) systems. It offers all the necessary tools to construct fully working *User Interfaces* (UIs), bringing together the design and engineering stages.

Among the main features **Incari** offers:

* No-code approach: **Incari Studio** uses a visual programming structure for the creation of its **Logic**, giving the user an easy way to create and visualize the functionality of their **Project**.
* Connectivity: **Incari Studio** can be very easily connected to external data sources. It supports several widely used protocols, such as HTTP, CAN, and MQTT.
* Rendering: The powerful *3D* rendering engine permits an easy-to-use and straight-forward visualization and construction of a *User Interface*.

## Documentation

The **Incari Studio** **Documentation** offers a detailed description of all the elements in **Incari Studio** and how to use them. It is divided into five sections, which are the following:

### [Getting Started](getting-started/overview.md)

This section describes everything necessary to get started with **Incari Studio**, from the system requirements to creating a first **Project**, including an installation guide and introductions to **Incari Hub** and **Incari Studio** itself.

### [Objects and Types](objects-and-types/overview.md)

The elements used to design *UIs* in **Incari** are called **Objects**. They come in several forms, can be customized via **Attributes**, and use different **Data Types**. This section describes the types of **Objects**, their **Attributes**, and the **Data Types** used in **Incari**. 

### [Modules](modules/overview.md)

**Incari's** *Interface* is divided into **Modules**, each with their own specific function. This section describes in detail every **Module** and its use. 

### [Toolbox](toolbox/overview.md)

One of the most important **Modules** in **Incari** is the [**Logic Editor**](modules/logic-editor.md), where the **Logic** of the **Project** is built. The **Logic** determines how the **Objects** in the created *Interface* interact and change. The **Toolbox** in the **Logic Editor** contains the [**Nodes**](modules/logic-editor.md#nodes), which are the building bricks of the **Logic** and in this section every **Node** is described in depth.

### [Demo Projects](demo-projects/overview.md)

**Demo Projects** are downloadable **Projects** that allow the user to see how certain functionalities are implemented in **Incari Studio**. This section describes every **Demo Project** available.
