# Pulse Flow Nodes

Pulse flow nodes, when combined with 

Branching is used to implement control flow along multiple different paths depending on the evaluation of certain conditions.

The **Branch** _node_ takes a single [**Boolean** ](../../../data-types/bool.md)value as an input and directs the flow of logic along one of two [**Pulses**](), depending on whether the input value is _true_ or _false._

By using a combination of _relational_ nodes \([**IsEqual**](), [**IsGreaterEqual**]() and [**IsLessEqual**]()\), Pulse flow nodes,
