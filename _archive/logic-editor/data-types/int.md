# Int

An **Int** \(Integer\) data type represents a numerical value; more specifically, a _whole, precise_ number \(negative or positive\).

Integers are used when no decimal point is required, such as the amount of people in a sports stadium.

They are very precise but only have a range of between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.

For very large numbers or very small numbers, [**Floats**](float.md) are a better fit, due to their higher range \(at the cost of precision\).
