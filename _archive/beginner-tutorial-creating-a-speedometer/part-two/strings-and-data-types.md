# Strings and Data Types

You may have noticed that **Nodes** in INCARI have different coloured **Input** and **Output Sockets**. This is because there are a few different **Data Types**, and each colour represents a different one. If you compare the colour of our **Speed Variable** with the **Input** colour of the **Console Node**, for instance, you will notice that they are different. This is because our **Variable** is an **Integer** \(whole numerical value\) and the **Console Node** takes **Strings** \(sequences of characters\) ****as **Input**.

Drag and drop our **Speed Variable** onto the **Node Graph**.

A **String** is a sequence of characters, which could be any combination of letters, words, numbers, symbols etc. Even if its value _looks_ like a number, it is no longer of any numerical value, and therefore cannot be used for mathematical equations. When we want to output information to the **Console** or display it in a **Text Object**, it must be a **String**.
