# Rotating Our Needle

All objects in INCARI are in 3D space and have 3 transformation attributes, representing position, rotation and scale. Each of these is a three-dimensional vector \([Vector3](../../logic-editor/data-types/vector3.md)\), meaning that they have a value for each of the X, Y and Z axes.

To modify these attributes, click the object in the Scene Outliner and then edit the values in the Attribute Editor.

As with most attributes in INCARI, you can define a _step_ to increase/decrease a value by, by right-clicking an attribute and selecting the desired increment from the popup menu. You can then use your mouse's scroll wheel \(or the up/down buttons\) to adjust the value.

* Select the needle graphic in the Scene Outliner.
* Change the Z-rotation value of the needle to be -135Â°, thus setting the Speedometer's value to 0.
