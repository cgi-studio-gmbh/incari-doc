### Incari Hub

**Incari Hub** serves as a central access point to all **Incari** products. It allows to install the latest version of **Incari**, manage your **Projects**, and obtain **Demo Projects**.

On the left-side Menu, there are two sections: *Projects* and *Applications*.

Under *Projects*, the tab *My Projects* allows the user to access, create, and manage their local **Projects**. The tab *Remote Projects* gives access to **Demo Projects** created by the **Incari** team, these can be downloaded and then opened locally. **Demo Projects** are useful to see how certain functionalities can be implemented in **Incari**.

Under *Applications*, **Incari Applications** can be accessed and managed. For each **Application**, it is possible to get the latest version, install it, and check for updates.

As seen in the previous section, **Incari Hub** also allows to manage the license and user account.
