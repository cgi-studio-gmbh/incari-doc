# Scene

![](../../.gitbook/assets/iconscene.png)

A **Scene** is a collection of Incari **Objects** such as **Mesh**, **Text**, **Sprite**, **Point Light**, **Spot Light**, etc. Each **Scene** can be rendered either in 2D or 3D space allowing for 2D or 3D views respectively. 

The 3D space is known as the **Editor View** in Incari and it allows a user to fully see how an **Object** functions in a **Scene**. Contrarily the 2D space mimics the view of Incari's **Player** and as such it is named the **Player View**. 

A **Scene** is accessed in Incari through the **Project Outliner**. It can be added to a **Project** either by adding it to a **Screen** or as one of the **Unassigned** **Scenes**. The created **Scene**, doesn't have any **Attributes** of its own, unlike every _other_ **Object** in Incari. However, its **Size** and **Resolution** are determined by the **Attributes** of the **Screen** that it is assigned to. 

In order to create an **Unassigned Scene**, click on the plus ![](../../.gitbook/assets/objects/project-objects/scene/plusIcon.PNG) icon located at the top of the **Project Outliner** and click on the **Scene** button.

Also by *right-clicking* on a **Scene** or **Screen** in the **Project Outliner** you can create an **Unassigned Scene** or a *child* **Scene** for that particular **Screen** respectively.
