# Mesh

## Overview

In other 3D applications, it is quite common to apply materials and textures directly to a 3D mesh. In **INCARI**, though, we have a specific **Mesh Object** which contains separate references to the 3D **Asset** \(the mesh data\) and **INCARI**'s own **Material** file, which contains **Shader** and **Texture** information.

Like any other **Scene Object**, we can manipulation the **Position**, **Rotation** and **Scale** of a **Mesh** using the **Transformation Attributes** and adjusting its **Rotation Pivot**.

## Mesh

### Mesh Asset

The `Mesh Asset` **Attribute** contains a reference to a 3D file in your **Asset Manager**. We currently have limited support for **.3ds, .ply, .dae** and **.fbx** files, however we recommend using **.obj** as the importer is well tested and rarely has any issues.

When you drag and drop a mesh from the **Asset Manager** into your **Scene** a **Mesh Object** is automatically created. If you need to assign the **Asset** manually, however, you can simply drag and drop the **Asset** onto the **Asset** slot of the **Attribute**.

## Material

### Material Asset

The `Material Asset` **Attribute** is used to apply a **Material Asset** to a **Mesh**. **Materials** can be created in the **Asset Manager** and edited in the **Material Editor**.

To assign a **Material Asset** to the **Attribute**, drag and drop it onto the **Asset** slot of the **Attribute**.
