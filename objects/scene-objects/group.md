# Group

The primary function of the **Group** **Object** is that it allows us to transform multiple **Objects**, relative to a single **Pivot Point**, as if though they are a single, unified **Object**.

Additionally, it is a useful way of organizing collections of **Objects** into categories, and making **Scenes** with high amounts of different **Objects**, more manageable.

Like any other **Scene Object**, we can manipulate the **Position**, **Rotation** and **Scale** of a **Sprite** using the **Transformation Attributes** and adjusting its **Rotation Pivot**.
