# Group

The primary function of the **Group** **Node** is that it allows us to transform multiple **Objects**, relative to a single **Pivot Point**, as if though they are a single, unified **Object**.

Additionally, it is a useful way of organizing collections of **Objects** into categories, and making **Scenes** with high amounts of different **Objects**, more manageable.

# Attributes

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Color`|**Color**|The **Color** of the **Group Object**.|
|`ZIndex`|**Int**|The `ZIndex` determines the stack order of the **Group** **Object**. Therefore a **Group** **Object** with a higher `ZIndex` will be in front of a **Group** **Object** with a lower `ZIndex` in the **Logic Editor**.|
|`Content Alpha`|**Int**|The *alpha* value of the **Group** **Object**.|
