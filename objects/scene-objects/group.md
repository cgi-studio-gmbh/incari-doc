# Group

The primary function of the **Group** **Node** is that it allows us to transform multiple **Objects**, relative to a single **Pivot Point**, as if though were a single, unified **Object**.

Additionally, it is a useful way of organising collections of **Objects** into categories, and making **Scenes** with high amounts of different **Objects**, more manageable.
