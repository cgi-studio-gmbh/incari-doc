A **Sprite** is an **Object** which places an image asset onto a two dimensional plane. 

As **Sprite** also shares some of its **Attributes** with other **Objects**, it is discussed in detail in the [**Sprite Attributes**](../attributes/common-attributes/sprite.md) page of the [**Common Attributes**](../attributes/common-attributes/README.md) section.
