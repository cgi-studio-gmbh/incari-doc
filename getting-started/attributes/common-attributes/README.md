# Common Attributes

The same sets of **Attributes** often appear in different **Objects**. The **Transformation Attributes**, for instance, are present on every kind of **Scene Object** in **INCARI**. This is why we have chosen to put commonly-shared sets of **Attributes** in a section of their own. If there are any caveats or atypical functionality within the context of a particular **Object**, then that information will be noted on its corresponding page.
