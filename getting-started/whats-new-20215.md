# What's New

Many new features have been added to the release of **Incari Studio** 2021.5. Here is a list of the features you need to know.

* **Asset Database**

  The new **Asset Database** allows the user to easily access internal resources and reuse them. With this, it is possible to keep track of which **Assets** are being used and where in the **Project**.

* **Camera Input for Video Objects**

  Now it is possible to directly control cameras and virtual cameras. New **Nodes** for controlling the playback have been introduced. Thus, this allows, for example, to control from **Incari** a rear-view camera and the video that is being obtained from it.

* **Masking**

  **Sprite Objects** can now have **Vectors** (or any other **Sprite Object**) as masks.

* **Materials Improvements**

  New features for working with Materials have been introduced. A Material can be created by simply dropping a texture **Asset** on a **Mesh**. Moreover, a preview of the Material on a **Mesh** is shown when dragging over it.

* **Render to Texture**

  A **Scene** can be rendered to **Sprite** from the same **Scene** or any other. This gives the possibility to create an image **Object** of the current state of a **Scene**.
