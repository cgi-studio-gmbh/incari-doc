*  Go to the **Incari** [website](https://www.incari.com/my-account/) and log-in, here you can manage your subscriptions and obtain the license key.

* Use the license key to activate your subscription in **Incari Hub**.


At the moment **Incari** relies on the Windows SDK that comes with Visual Studio (free version).
So the user also needs to install the Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (Desktop Development C++ setup), start it once and create a profile.
