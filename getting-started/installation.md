# Installation

At the moment **Incari** relies on the Windows SDK that comes with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (free version).
Then, the first step is to install the Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (Desktop Development C++ setup), start it once and create a profile.

For installation and licensing of **Incari Studio**, please follow these steps:
