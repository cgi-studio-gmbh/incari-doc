* [**Tags**](../objects-and-types/attributes/common-attributes/tag.md)

    A new **Attribute** has been introduced for all **Objects** in **Incari**: *Tags*. *Tags* are simple labels linked to **Objects** and are managed in the **Attribute Editor**, where they can be created, deleted, and edited. These *tags* allow the user to group and link different **Objects** under the same *tag*.

    There are also **Nodes** that allow the user to manage *tags* in the **Logic**. These are:

    * [**Add Tag**](../toolbox/incari/object/add-tag.md), which adds a *tag* to an **Object**.
    * [**Get Objects By Tag**](../toolbox/incari/object/get-objects-by-tag.md), which gives all **Objects** that share a specified *tag*.
    * [**Remove Tag**](../toolbox/incari/object/remove-tag.md), which removes a *tag* from an **Object**.

 
* **New Objects and grouping**
