# Prefabs

## Overview

**Prefabs** are a feature that allow to create multiple individual instances of a combination of **Objects** in a *User Interface*, and then make changes that are enacted across all instances. This allows one to easily create several **Objects** with the same functionality that retain unique properties via overrides. Moreover, **Prefabs** have their own **Logic** encapsulated within them. Any alterations in the **Prefab** properties or its **Logic** affect all of its instances.
