# Prefabs

## Overview

**Prefabs** are a feature that allow to create multiple individual instances of a combination of **Objects** in a *User Interface*, and then make changes that are enacted across all instances. This allows one to easily create several **Objects** with the same functionality that retain unique properties via overrides. Moreover, **Prefabs** have their own **Logic** encapsulated within them. Any alterations in the **Prefab** properties or its **Logic** affect all of its instances.

## Creating and Using Prefabs

For creating a **Prefab**, go to the **Scene Outliner** and select the **Objects** that will compose the **Prefab**, then right-click and click on `Make Prefab`. This will create a **Prefab** consisting of the selected **Objects** and a new **Prefab** **Asset** will be generated in the **Asset Manager**.

New instances of the **Prefab** can be created by either duplicating the existing **Prefab** in the **Scene Outliner** or by dragging the **Prefab Asset** from the **Asset Manager** to the **Scene Outliner** or the **Scene**.
