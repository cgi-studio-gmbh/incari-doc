# Group

The **Group** **Object** works like a folder, as it allows you to structure and organize **Objects**, making **Scenes** with high amounts of different **Objects** more manageable.

Another useful function of the **Group** **Object** is that it allows us to transform multiple **Objects** relative to a single **Pivot Point**, as if they were are a single **Object**.

Like any other **Scene Object**, we can manipulate its **Transformation Attributes** and adjust its **Rotation Pivot**.
