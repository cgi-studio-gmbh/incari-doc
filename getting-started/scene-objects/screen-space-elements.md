As *Incari* can use both **2D** and **3D** **Assets**, it is necessary that the coordinate system is **3D**. The downside of this is that most designers work with a layer-based, 2D coordinate system which presents the need to convert each **Assetâ€™s** position in 2D space to the same relative position in 3D. This can be a slow and tedious process.

With the introduction of **Screen** **Space** **Elements**, though, it is much easier for UI/UX designers using 2D-based tools to transfer their designs into *Incari* without the extra step of performing individual conversions. Designers can now import **Assets** from third-party content creation software, such as *Photoshop* or *Figma*, direcly into *Incari*.

The **2D** **Objects** available in *Incari* fall under two groups in the **Scene Outliner**. These are **2D** and **Vector2D**. These provide 2D counterparts to those under **3D** and **Vector3D** and are only editable within two-dimensional space, meaning that their position is only contained within the *x* and *y* axes.

The **Vector2D Objects** provide 2D alternatives to their 3D **Vector** counterparts and encompass several two-dimensional shapes that help build up the visual aspects of a **User Interface**. 

* **Arc2D**
* **Ellipse2D**
* **Line2D**
* **Pie2D** 
* **Rectangle2D**
