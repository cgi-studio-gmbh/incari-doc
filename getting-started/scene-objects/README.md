# Scene Objects

An **Object** in **INCARI** is any entity which can be added to a **Scene**. "**Object**" is a broad term used to describe a number of different components, each with their own purpose, behaviours and characteristics.

All **Objects** in a **Scene** appear in the **Scene Outliner**, exist in 3D space, and therefore, have **Transformation Attributes.**

## Creating an Object

For creating an **Object**, go to the **Scene Outliner**, click the plus sign on the top left and select the **Object** to create.
