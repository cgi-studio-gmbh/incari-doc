# What's New

Many new features have been added to the release of **Incari Studio** 2022.1. Here is a list of the features you need to know.

* **Global and Local Transfrom** 

    Originally, it was only possible to make changes in global space (i.e. in relation to the origin). Now it is possible to make object transformations locally in relation to the object itself. For example, if the user wishes to rotate an object around itself, this is now much easier with local transform. Switch the toggle `LocalMode` to enable and disable this feature. 

  * [**On Local Position Change**]
  * [**On Local Rotation Change**]
  * [**Set Local Position**]
  * [**Get Local Position**]
  * [**Set Local Rotation**]
  * [**Get Local Rotation**]
  * [**On Global Position Change**]
  * [**On Global Rotation Change**]
  * [**Set Global Position**]
  * [**Get Global Postion**]
  * [**Set Global Rotation**]
  * [**Get Global Rotation**]


* **Flip Normals** 

    To aid in providing a more immersive experience, `Flip Normals`, located under `Normals` for an **Object** in the **Attribute Editor** can help. When the toggle is switched on, it is possible to see an applied **Material** from within an **Object**. The user can rotate, move, and scale as usual. 


* **`.glTF` files**

     Incari now supports `.glTF` files


* **Material Editor Update**
  
   environment, normal maps, occlusion map, new pbr material (extended pbr material)


* **Prefabs**
    create a button. so that when you hover over, it changes color. you can do it now by making two buttons. we can now make a prefab using it. so can now duplicate this prefab object (save prefab) and all instances will update itself, don't have to do it one by one. can overrride some properties. , but unique properties remain. 
    prefab input and output - declaration of the prefab and then use it. it mmeans it's registered and events inside of it are registered and ready to be used. can export prefab and take all assets/asset ids and put them together in a directory. can send to someone else then. helps with sharing data between projects 



* **Plugins** 
  
    first attempt at plugin manager. in pougin window, something called communication -> serial manager -> currently activated. will be similar for all communication layer. everything will be imported to plugs. won't be in project settings anymore??? or logic editor (commu ication serial). this means that plugin is off, player won't load it. this will improve performance and stability




* [**Format Node**] -

* [**HTTP Client Node Update**]
