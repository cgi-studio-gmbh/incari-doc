# What's New

With the release of Incari Studio 2021.3, there appeared a number of new features. Here is a list of the features you need to know.

* **Primitives**

* [**Directional Lights**](scene-objects/lights.md)

*Incari* has added a third type of **Light** that extends the capabilities of lighting and shadows in a **Scene**.

* [**Normal Maps**](../modules/material-editor.md)

With **Normal Maps** now available in the **Materials Editor**, users of *Incari* can now take advantage of this texturing technique that will limit rendering time while also improving the complexity of **Materials**.

* **Screen Space Elements**

* **Build Module v1**

* **CPU Profiler Integration**
  
    _Incari_ has now a **Profiler** tool integrated, which allows to analyze the performance of any **Block** of **Nodes** in the **Logic**. To use it, a **Profiler Block** using the new [**Profiler Start**](../toolbox/development/profiler-start.md) and [**Profiler Stop**](../toolbox/development/profiler-stop.md) **Nodes** has to be created and then the [**Profiler View Module**](../modules/profiler-view.md) is used for capturing and analyzing the performance of the **Blocks**.
