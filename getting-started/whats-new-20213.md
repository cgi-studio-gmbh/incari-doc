# What's New

With the release of Incari Studio 2021.3, there appeared a number of new features. Here is a list of the features you need to know.

* **Primitives**

* **Directional Lights**

* **Normal Maps**

* **Screen Space Elements**

* **Build Module v1**

* **CPU Profiler Integration**
  
    _Incari_ has now a **Profiler** tool integrated, which allows to analyze the performance of any **Block** of **Nodes** in the **Logic**. To use it, a **Profiler Block** using the new [**Profiler Start**](../toolbox/development/profiler-start.md) and [**Profiler Stop**](../toolbox/development/profiler-stop.md) **Nodes** has to be created and then the [**Profiler View Module**](../modules/profiler-view.md) is used for capturing and analyzing the performance of the **Blocks**.
