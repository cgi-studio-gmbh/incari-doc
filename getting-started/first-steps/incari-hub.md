# Incari Hub

**Incari Hub** serves as a central access point to all **Incari** products. It allows one to install the latest version of **Incari**, manage existing **Projects**, and obtain **Demo Projects**.

On the left-side Menu, there are several sections. We will go through each, one by one. Feel free to jump to the section you are most interested in:

## Projects

### My Projects

*My Projects* allows the user to access, create, and manage their local **Projects**. Here there are two existing **Projects** called *test* and *test2*. The leftmost square with the plus icon is used to [create a new **Project**.](creating-a-project2.md) 

![My Projects](../../.gitbook/assets/projectsmyprojects.png)

Each **Project** displays the username and **Incari Studio** version at the bottom. Clicking on the three dots that appear when hovering over a **Project** allow the user to open the **Project**, play the **Project** in **Incari Player**, show **Project** in the user's local file library, and the **Project's** settings. It is also possible to delete the **Project** from here, either by removing it from the hub or deleting it completely from the local disk.

### Remote Projects

 The tab *Remote Projects* gives access to **Demo Projects** that have been created by our very own **Incari** team :) These can be downloaded with the small cloud icon. The **Project** will then appear under *My Projects* and can be opened from there. 
 
 **Demo Projects** allow one to see how certain functionalities can be implemented in **Incari**. These range from a simple button to examples of the several methods of **Animation** available to the user. Discover more in the [**Demo Projects**](demo-../../demo-projects/overview.md) documentation.

 ## Applications

 ### Incari Studio

Under *Incari Studio*, one can install different versions of **Incari Studio**. This can be done by locating a folder on your local machine, where **Incari Studio** is installed, or using the built-in installer. If there are no installations, a message will appear prompting the user to either `Locate` or `Install` a version of **Incari Studio**. Otherwise, the user can use the icon on the top right to do the same. 

Note: Locating does not install **Incari Studio**. It simply points to where it is already existing on your computer after you have clicked through the file library that pops up.

Please note that if an existing **Project** was made with a previous version of **Incari Studio**, and this version is not currently installed within **Incari Hub**, you will be prompted to upgrade the most recent version or locate the compatible version. Otherwise it will be impossible to open the **Project**.
