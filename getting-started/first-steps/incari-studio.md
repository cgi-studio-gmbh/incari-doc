# Incari Studio

After creating a **Project** from **Incari Hub**, **Incari Studio** starts and loads this newly created empty **Project**.

The *Interface* is composed of the **Viewport** and the **Modules**. The **Viewport** contains what will be displayed when the **Project** is played and the different **Modules** offer distinct functionalities to work in the **Project**. For a detailed description of each **Module**, see the **Modules** category of the **Documentation** on the left-hand side index. This page will deal with all the possibilities that **Incari** offers for accommodating the *Interface* as the user desires.

When starting a new **Project**, the **Incari Studio** *Interface* looks as in the following image:

Since there are many **Modules**, **Incari Studio** offers the possibility of showing or hiding each of them as it is suitable for the user and their work. Therefore, each **Module** can be either shown or hidden. There are several ways of changing the visibility of **Modules**:

* **Modules** can be made visible from the `View` menu in the top bar.

* **Modules** can be shown or hidden by right-clicking the top bar and selecting or deselecting them.

* **Modules** can be hidden by clicking the `x` in the top right corner of each of them.

Besides giving the option to choose which **Modules** are visible, **Incari Studio** gives the user total freedom to customize how the visible **Modules** are organized. Particularly, their position and size can be set by the user.

Moreover, Modules can be docked together and then accessed via the tabs that are automatically created.

Modules can be also used as independent windows, which can be very useful when working with more than one screen.

Modules that are individual windows can be locked so they do not dock on the main Incari Studio interface. This is done by clicking on the lock icon that appears on the top-right of a module that is being seen as an independent window.

This way, the *Interface* of **Incari Studio** can be customized in the way that best suits the user and their work.
