# Incari Studio

After creating a **Project** from **Incari Hub**, **Incari Studio** starts and loads this newly created empty **Project**.

The *Interface* is composed of the **Viewport** and the **Modules**. The **Viewport** contains what will be displayed when the **Project** is played and the different **Modules** offer distinct functionalities to work in the **Project**. For a detailed description of each **Module**, see the **Modules** category of the **Documentation** on the left-hand side index. This page deals with all the possibilities that **Incari** offers in order to accommodate the user's preferences regarding the *Interface*.  

When starting a new **Project**, the **Incari Studio** *Interface* looks as in the following image:

There are many **Modules** available in **Incari Studio**. The user can show or hide any **Module** at their discretion in order to customize their workspace. There are several ways of changing the visibility of **Modules**:

* **Modules** can be made visible from the `View` menu in the top bar.

* **Modules** can be shown or hidden by right-clicking the top bar and selecting or deselecting them.

* **Modules** can be hidden by clicking the `x` in the top right corner of each of them.

Besides giving the option to choose which **Modules** are visible, **Incari Studio** gives the user total freedom to customize how the visible **Modules** are organized. Particularly, their position and size can be set by the user.

Moreover, **Modules** can be docked together and then accessed via the tabs that are automatically created.

**Modules** can be also used as independent windows, which can be very useful when working with more than one screen.

**Modules** that are individual windows can be locked so they do not dock on the main Incari Studio interface. This is done by clicking on the lock icon that appears on the top-right of a **Module** that is being seen as an independent window.

This way, the *Interface* of **Incari Studio** can be customized in the way that best suits the user and their work.
