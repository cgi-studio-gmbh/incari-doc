    Description
* [**Integration with Third-Party Software**]
  
    **Incari** now lets users incorporate several third-party softwares into their **Projects** that encompass different categories. These include math libraries ([*Eigen*](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [*GLM*](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8.5/)), an **MQTT** message broker ([*Mosquitto*](http://mosquitto.org/)), **HTTP** clients ([*cpp-httplib*](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) and [*civetweb*](http://civetweb.github.io/civetweb/)), an **HTTP** server ([*civetweb*](http://civetweb.github.io/civetweb/)), *websocket* ([*civetweb*](http://civetweb.github.io/civetweb/)), and a *Javascript* library for web applications ([*SocketIO*](https://socket.io/)). These integrations improve the capabilities of **Incari Projects** and provide further functionality with a little boost from other softwares. 
* [**Performance Improvements**]
  
    A few simple performance improvements have been added to the newest version of **Incari**. The user can now export a **Project** as a single `.zip` file, binarize a **Project** to export, as well as take advantage of the enhanced rendering engine performance. These will help strengthen the Incari experience.
