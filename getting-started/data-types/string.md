# String

A **String** is a data type that represents a sequence of alphanumerical characters.

They are most commonly used to hold words and text.

Numbers can also be represented as **Strings**, but they are still text, not numbers; for instance, $$1 + 1 = 2$$ in _numerical_ terms, but $$"1" + "1" = "11"$$ in _string_ terms, because it is text added together not actual values.

In **Incari**, there is a special category of **Nodes** \([**String**](../../toolbox/string/)\) for creating and handling **Strings**.
