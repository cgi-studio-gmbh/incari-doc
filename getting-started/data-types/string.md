# String

A **String** is a data type which represents a sequence of alphanumerical characters.

They are most commonly used to hold text, whether that be something small like a user's name or an entire paragraph.

Numbers can also be represented as strings, but they are still text, not numbers; for instance, $$1 + 1 = 2$$ in _numerical_ terms, but $$"1" + "1" = "11"$$ in _string_ terms, because you are adding text together not actual values.
