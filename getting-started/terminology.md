* [**Project**](../modules/project-outliner.md): A collection of **Screens** with their corresponding **Scenes**.
* [**Assets**](): Files in the **Project** **Asset** folder. They can be linked to and modify **Objects**. 
* [**Event**](../toolbox/events/README.md): Action or occurrence that triggers a **Logic Branch**, represented in the **Logic Graph** by the **Events** **Nodes**.
* [**Data Types**](data-types/README.md): A classification of data values into several categories that specify how they are read by the program and which operations they can be subjected to.
* [**Node**](../modules/logic-editor.md#nodes): Components of the **Logic Graph** that evaluate data values or represent **Variables**, **Events**, or **Objects**.
* [**Flow Control**](../toolbox/flow-control/README.md): Type of **Nodes** that are used to define the order in which the logic is evaluated.
* [**Pulse**](../modules/logic-editor.md#pulse): Connections that determine the order of execution of **Nodes**.
* [**Input**](../modules/logic-editor.md#sockets): **Node** **Sockets** that receive data or pulses.
* [**Output**](../modules/logic-editor.md#sockets): **Node** **Sockets** that send data or pulses.
* [**Attributes**](attributes/README.md): Collection of customizable characteristics of **Objects**, **Nodes**, **Screens**, and **Scenes**.
* [**Euclidean division**](../toolbox/math/modulo.md): Process of dividing one integer by another, producing a quotient and a remainder.
