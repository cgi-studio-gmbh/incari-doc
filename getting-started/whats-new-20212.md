# What's New

With the release of Incari Studio 2021.2, there appeared a number of new features. Here is a list of the features you need to know.

* **New Incari Project Updater** 
  
    The new Incari Project Updater migrates projects from older versions of **Incari Studio** to 2021.2. In **Incari Hub**, the list of projects is shown, each one indicating to which version it corresponds. When opening a project from an older version, **Incari Studio** will ask the user if they would like to directly update the project to the new version or to make a copy and update this copy, then it automatically migrates the project to the 2021.2 version of **Incari**.


* **Scene as Incari Object with attributes**

    Now **Scenes** are treated as **Objects** with their own **Attributes**.
