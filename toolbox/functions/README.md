# Functions

## Introduction

The **Functions Nodes** allow the user to create their own **Nodes**, customizing the **Input** and **Output** **Sockets** and the operation performed by the **Node**.

**Functions** can be created in the **Functions** tab on the left panel of the **Logic Editor** with the **Add Function** option and then the **Node** will appear in the **Toolbox**.

Each **Function** has its own **Logic**, which is defined by the user. This **Logic** has a **Function Input** and a **Function Output** **Node**, and any other **Node** can be added to it. To open the **Function**'s **Logic** tab, either double click the **Node** or the **Function** on the **Function**'s list.

**Functions** can be exported and then imported in a different **Project**.
