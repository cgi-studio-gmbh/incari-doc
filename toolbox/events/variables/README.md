# Variables

## Introduction

The **Variable Nodes** are **Event Listener Nodes** that allow to execute a **Logic Branch** triggered by setting or changing the value of a variable. 

For each variable, two **Nodes** appear in the **Toolbox**. One that is activated when the variable is set and another that is activated when the variable changes value.
