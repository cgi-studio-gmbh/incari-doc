# Introduction

**Keyboard Events** are used to trigger different pieces of **Logic** for the purpose of interactivity, testing, and debugging. In the absence of real input, such as foot pedals, **CAN** data, and physical buttons, they are an excellent way of *simulating* interaction and dynamically adjusting values on the fly. During the development stage they are used extensively to provide instant feedback between the developer and **Incari Player**.
