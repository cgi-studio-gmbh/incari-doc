## Introduction

The **Custom Nodes** are **Event** **Nodes** that allow to execute a **Logic Branch** triggered by any other part of the **Logic**. For this, each **Custom Event** has two **Nodes**: a [**Trigger**](event-trigger.md) and a [**Listener**](event-listener.md). The **Listener Node** is activated when the **Trigger Node** is executed by a **Pulse**.
