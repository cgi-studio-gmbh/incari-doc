## Overview

![The On Key Press Node.](../../.gitbook/assets/node-on-key-press.png)

**On Key Press** is used for triggering logic using key presses on a computer keyboard.

## Attributes

### Miscellaneous

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Repeat Enabled` | **Bool** | Whether or not the **Event** is triggered while the key is _held_ down, or just when initially clicked. |

### Event

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Key` | **Drop-down** | The key that Incari will _listen_ for. |

## Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _Pulse Output_ \(â–º\) | **Pulse** | Moves onto the next part of the **Logic** once the assigned key is pressed \(or held\). |
| `Is Alt` | **Bool** | Whether or not the **Alt** key was also pressed in combination with the assigned key. |
| `Is Ctrl` | **Bool** | Whether or not the **Ctrl** key was also pressed in combination with the assigned key. |
| `Is Shift` | **Bool** | Whether or not the **Shift** key was also pressed in combination with the assigned key. |
| `Is Repeated` | **Bool** | Indicates whether this is a repeated/subsequent firing of the **Event** \(`true`\) or the initial time it is fired \(`false`\). If the `Repeat Enabled` **Attribute** is enabled, the output will always be `false` because the **Event** is only fired on the initial press. |
