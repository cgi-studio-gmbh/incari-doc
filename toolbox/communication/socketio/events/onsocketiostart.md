# Overview

![The On SocketIO Start Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onsocketiostart.png)

**On SocketIO Start** is an **Event Listener Node** notifying that the **SocketIO** connection was successfully established, therefore enabling the user to trigger a **Logic Branch** on said connection to the *SocketIO* server.

**SocketIO Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On SocketIO Start** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.

[**Scope**](../../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
