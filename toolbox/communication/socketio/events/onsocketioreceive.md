# Overview

![The On Socket.IO Receive Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onsocketioreceivenode20241.png)

**On Socket.IO Receive** is an **Event Listener Node** that executes and triggers a **Logic Branch** when data of a **Socket.IO** event is received and returns its `Message`, name, and `Namespace`.

**Socket.IO Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On Socket.IO Receive** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../../modules/plugins/communication/socketiomanager.md) to find out more information.

[**Scope**](../../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
