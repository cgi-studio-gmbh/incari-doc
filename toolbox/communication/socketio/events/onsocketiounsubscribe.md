**On Socket.IO Unsubscribe** is an **Event Listener Node** allowing the user to trigger a **Logic Branch** once a **Socket.IO** event has been unsubscribed from. 

**Socket.IO Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On Socket.IO Unsubscribe** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.
