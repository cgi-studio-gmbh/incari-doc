# CAN

## Introduction

The **CAN Nodes** provide a means for the user to perform several actions within the _CAN_ messaging protocol. _CAN_, or _Controller Area Network_, allows for communication among different devices, such as different electronic parts of a vehicle. To use the **CAN Nodes** in **Incari**, the user needs to locate the **CAN Attributes** in **Project Settings** and upload a _DBC_ file.
