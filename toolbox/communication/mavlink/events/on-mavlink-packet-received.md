# Overview

![The On MAVlink Packet Received Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onmavlinkpacketreceive.png)

**On MAVLink Packet Received**  is an **Event Listener Node** allowing the user to trigger a **Logic Branch** when *MAVLink* data  is received and returns it in the form of a binary `Message`. This message needs to be decoded to access the data, which is done with [**MAVLink Decode**](../mavlink-decode.md).

**MAVLink Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On MAVLink Packet Received** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.

[**Scope**](../../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
