# Overview

![The On WebSocket Error Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onwebsocketerrornode20241.png)

The **On WebSocket Error Node** is an **Event Listener Node** that is triggered if the specified *WebSocket* connection encounters an error during any action and returns the error `Message`.

**WebSocket Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On WebSocket Error** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.
