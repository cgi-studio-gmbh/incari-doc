# Overview

![The On WebSocket Start Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onwebsocketstartnode.png)

The **On WebSocket Start Node** is an **Event Listener Node** notifying that the **WebSocket** connection was successfully established, therefore enabling the user to perform actions on said connection.

**WebSocket Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On WebSocket Start** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.

[**Scope**](../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
