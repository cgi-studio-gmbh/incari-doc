# Overview

![The On WebSocket Stop Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onwebsocketstopnode.png)

The **On WebSocket Stop Node** is an **Event Listener Node** that gives the user a way to perform an action once a **WebSocket** connection has been terminated.

**WebSocket Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On WebSocket Stop** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.

[**Scope**](../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
