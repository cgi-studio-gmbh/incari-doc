![The On UDP Start Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onudpstart.png)

**On UDP Start** is an **Event Listener Node** notifying that the **UDP** connection was successfully established, therefore enabling the user to trigger a **Logic Branch** on said connection to the *UDP* server.

**UDP Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On UDP Start** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information..

[**Scope**](../../../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
