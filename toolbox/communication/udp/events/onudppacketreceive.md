# Overview

![The On UDP Packet Receive Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/onudppacketreceivenode20241.png)

**On UDP Packet Receive** is an **Event Listener Node** that listens to an established **UDP** connection and outputs the `Message` data given, therefore enabling the user to trigger a **Logic Branch** when the `Message` is received.

**UDP Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On UDP Packet Receive** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.

[**Scope**](../../../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
