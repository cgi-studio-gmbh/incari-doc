# Overview

![The On TCP Packet Receive Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/ontcppacketreceive.png)

**On TCP Packet Receive** is an **Event Listener Node** that listens to an established **TCP** connection and outputs the `Message` data given, therefore enabling the user to trigger a **Logic Branch** when the `Message` is received. 

**TCP Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On TCP Packet Receive** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../../modules/plugins/communication/tcpconnectionsmanager.md) to find out more information.

[**Scope**](../../../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
