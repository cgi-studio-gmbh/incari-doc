# Overview

![The On TCP Start Node.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/ontcpstart.png)

**On TCP Start** is an **Event Listener Node** notifying that the **TCP** connection was successfully established, therefore enabling the user to trigger a **Logic Branch** on said connection to the *TCP* server.

**SocketIO Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On TCP Start** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../../modules/plugins/communication/tcpconnectionsmanager.md) to find out more information..

[**Scope**](../../../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**.
