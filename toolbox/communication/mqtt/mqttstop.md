# MQTT Stop

## Overview

![The MQTT Stop Node.](../../../.gitbook/assets/mqttstopnode20241.png)

The **MQTT Stop Node** stops the **MQTT** connection.

It is important to note that while the **MQTT Stop Node** stops a **MQTT** connection, it may not completely finish disconnecting from said connection when the **Node** is executed. This could lead to the **Logic** attached to its **Output Pulse** 
to not work even though there is technically nothing wrong. In order to avoid this, it is highly suggested to use 
the [**On MQTT Stop Node**](events/onmqttstop.md) instead. This way, the **Logic** will only execute once the **MQTT** connection has definitely been disconnected from. This way, it is assured that the **Logic** will execute once the connection to the **MQTT** connection has been terminated.

Again, the user must first use the **MQTT Stop Node** to close the connection. Separately, the **On MQTT Stop Node** can be used to execute the desired **Communication Logic**.
