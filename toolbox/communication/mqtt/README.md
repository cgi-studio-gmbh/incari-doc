## Introduction

The **MQTT Nodes** provide a means for the user to perform several actions within the _MQTT_ messaging protocol. _MQTT_, or _Message Queuing Telemetry Transport_, allows the communication among devices and is commonly used in _IoT_ applications. To use the **MQTT Nodes** in _Incari_, the user needs to locate the **MQTT Attributes** in **Project Settings** and add a `Connection`.
