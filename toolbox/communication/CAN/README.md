# Introduction

The **CAN Nodes** provide a means for the user to perform several actions within the *CAN* messaging protocol. *CAN*, or *Controller Area Network* allows for communication among different devices, such as different electronic parts of a vehicle. To use the **CAN Nodes** in *Incari*, the user needs to locate the **CAN Attributes**  in **Project Settings** and upload a *DBC* file to gain full functionality of the **Nodes**.
