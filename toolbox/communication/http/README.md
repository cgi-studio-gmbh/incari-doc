# HTTP

## Introduction

The **HTTP Nodes** provide a means for the user to perform several actions within the _HTTP_ protocol. _HTTP_, or _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_, allows for communication between servers and clients by way of requests and responses using different methods. To use the **HTTP Nodes** in **Incari**, the user needs to locate the [**HTTP Attributes**](https://docs.incari.com/incari-studio/v/2021.1/modules/project-settings#http) in **Project Settings** and add a server.
