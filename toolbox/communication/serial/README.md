## Introduction

The **Serial** **Nodes** allow the user to connect with USB and GPS devices such as a GPS mouse by using *Serial* *Communication*. *Serial* *Communication* sends single bits of data at a time, sequentially, through a communication channel/bus. To use the **Serial** **Nodes** in **Incari**, the user first needs to locate the **Serial** **Attributes** in **Project** **Settings** and add a `Connection`.
