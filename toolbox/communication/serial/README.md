# Serial

## Introduction

The **Serial Nodes** provide a means for the user to perform several actions within the _Serial Communication_ protocol. _Serial Communication_ is a type of communication that sends single bits of data at a time, sequentially, through a communication channel/bus.  To use the **Serial Nodes** in **Incari**, the user needs to locate the **Serial Attributes** in **Project Settings** and add a `Connection`.
