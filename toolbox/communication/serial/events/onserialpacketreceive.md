The **On Serial Packet Receive Node** is an **Event Listener Node** that executes when a data **Packet** is received and returns its `Message`.

**Serial Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On Serial Packet Receive** will not show up in the [**Toolbox**](../../../overview.md). Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../modules/plugins/README.md) to find out more information.
