**Serial Communication** in **Incari** is available as a plugin and is enabled as default. However, in the case that it is disabled in the **Plugins Editor**, it will not appear in the **Project Settings** and **On Serial Stop** will not show up in the **Toolbox**. Please refer to the [**Plugins Editor**](../../../modules/plugins-editor.md) to find out more information.
