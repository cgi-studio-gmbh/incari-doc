# Actions

## Introduction

The **Actions Nodes** perform a set of **Actions**, usually over an **Object**, and allow to continue the **Pulse Flow** when the corresponding **Action** begins and ends.

These **Nodes** allow the user to create an animation by modifying an **Attribute** of a determined **Object** over a specified amount of time.

The **Node** name shows which **Attribute** is modified and which values are set by the user.

Each **Action** has an **Instance ID**, which is an unique identifier that can be set with the [**Create CustomID Node**](). The default **Instance ID** for **Actions** is 0.
