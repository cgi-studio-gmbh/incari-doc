# Overview

![The Add Tag Node.](../../../.gitbook/assets/addtagnode20241.png)

The **Add Tag Node** attaches a *tag* to an **Object**. This *tag* acts as *metadata* and can be used later to identify many **Objects** by a shared *tag*. 

It is important to note that when a *tag* is added with the **Add Tag Node**, the *tag* is only added once executed in the **Incari Player** and does not interact in any way with the *tags* added in the `Attributes` of an **Object** in **Incari Studio**. For example, this **Node** could be used for an **Object** created on runtime.

[**Scope**](../../overview.md#scopes): **Scene**, **Function**, **Prefab**.
