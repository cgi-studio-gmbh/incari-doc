# Overview

![The Ultrahaptics Play Node.](../../../.gitbook/assets/ultrahapticsplay.png)

The **Ultrahaptics Play Node** receives a JSON file generated by the *UltraHaptics Sensation Editor* (found [here](https://developer.ultrahaptics.com/downloads/sensation-editor/)). This allows the user to incorporate *UltraLeap* hand tracking into the **Incari Player**.

Before the JSON file can be hooked up as input, it must first be loaded with [**Load File**](../../io/loadfile.md).

Once all of this is completed, it is possible to trigger *haptics* sensations via **Incari Nodes**, meaning that the JSON file provides the instructions for the haptic that is to be played. 

Please refer to the [**External Links**](#external-links) for more information on *UltraLeap* technology. 

[**Scope**](../../overview.md#scopes): **Scene**, **Function**, **Prefab**.
