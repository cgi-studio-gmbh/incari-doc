# ImageSequence

## Introduction
The **ImageSequence Nodes** provide a means for the user to perform many actions on an **ImageSequence**, which can be added as an **ImageSequence Sprite** in the **Scene Outliner Module** after being created and edited in the **ImageSequence Editor**. **ImageSequences** are a good way to execute simple animations, such as a button being pressed, and a more in-depth explanation can be found in the **4 Methods of Animation** section which is linked below under **See Also**.
