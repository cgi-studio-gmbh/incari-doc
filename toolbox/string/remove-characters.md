# Overview

![The RemoveCharacters Node.](../../.gitbook/assets/removecharactersupdatedimage.png)

The **RemoveCharacters** **Node** removes characters from a **String**. It takes as inputs a **String** and the characters to remove and it outputs the **String** with the characters removed.

It removes all occurrences of each of the characters specified. For instance, giving `The dogs and the foxes go towards that house` for the **String** input and `os` for the characters to be removed will result in the output: `The dg and the fxe g tward that hue`.

[**Scope**](../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**, **Function**, **Prefab**.
