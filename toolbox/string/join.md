# Overview

![The Join Node.](../../.gitbook/assets/joinupdatedimage.png)

<!-- The **Join Node** joins the elements of an **Array** populated with **Strings** into a generated **String**, separated by a separator given by the user. -->

The **Join Node** joins several **Strings** into one. For this, it receives an **Array** populated with the **Strings** to be joined and a separator as inputs. The output is a **String** composed of the **Strings** in the input **Array** separated by the given separator.

For instance, having the **Array** `[uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco]` and a semicolon separator (`;`) as inputs generates the **String** `uno;dos;tres;cuatro;cinco`. 

[**Scope**](../overview.md#scopes): **Project**, **Scene**, **Function**, **Prefab**.
