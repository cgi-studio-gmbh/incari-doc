Incari has a couple of **Nodes** relating to io (input/output) functionality. These can be used to save and load persistent data between sessions. These **Nodes** are:

*  [**Save File**](savefile.md) - Allows a user to save a variable for future use.
*  [**Load File**](loadfile.md) - Allows a user to load a previously saved variable in the current project.
