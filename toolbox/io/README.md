# IO

## Introduction

**Incari** has several **Nodes** relating to _io_ \(input/output\) functionality. These can be used to create a file from scratch, set or return the working *directory*, list all content within a directory, get a file's file *extension*, save and load persistent data between sessions, as well as remove a file by deleting it.

Some **Nodes** -- namely **Save File**, **Create File**, and **Remove** -- only have influence over the **Asset Folder**. The others can be used to execute their respective *io* processes anywhere.
