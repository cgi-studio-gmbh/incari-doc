Incari has several **Nodes** for performing functions relating to _exponentiation_. They all take two _known_ parameters and return the 3rd _unknown_ value. These **Nodes** are:

* [**Power**](power.md) - Multiplies the _base_ value, against itself, a number of times defined by the _exponent_.
* [**Root**](root.md) - Calculates the _nth root_ of a _base_ value, where _n_ is defined by the _degree_.
* [**Logarithm**](https://github.com/cgi-studio-gmbh/incari-doc/tree/66656c2442958de634bc73f77b533a03f83df0fb/toolbox/math/logarithm.md) - Calculates the _exponent_ to which the _base_ value needs to be raised, to yield the input value.
